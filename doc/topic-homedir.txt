The RockZ home directory
========================

Each rockenv is stored in a subdirectory of the home directory. The variable
${ROCKZ_HOME} defines the path to the home directory. If not overriden, its
default value is "~/.rockenvs". To configure a custom path, define the
variable in your "~/.zshrc":

  ROCKZ_HOME=/path/to/rockenvs

The variable does not need to be exported, and it will be honored regardless
of whether it has been defined before or after sourcing RockZ. This means that
you can redefine ${ROCKZ_HOME} from an interactive shell, but note that setting
the home directory while a rockenv is active is unsupported.
