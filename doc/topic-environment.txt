Environment Variables
=====================

RockZ uses the following environment variables:

* ROCKZ_LUAROCKS_VERSION: Version of LuaRocks to be installed in new
  rockenvs. By default this is "2.3.0", and can be overriden both in your
  "~/.zshrc" or interactively.

* ROCKZ_LUAROCKS_DISTURL: Base URL to a location containing tarballs for
  LuaRocks. By default this is "http://luarocks.org/releases/", and can
  be overriden both in your "~/.zshrc" or interactively.

* ROCKZ_HOME: Path to the home directory where rockenvs are kept.
  (Use "rockz help homedir" for more information.)

* ROCK_ENV: Path to the active rockenv. Undefined if no rockenv
  is active.

* ROCK_ENV_NAME: Name of the active rockenv. Undefined if no rockenv
  is active. This is always the last path component of ${ROCK_ENV}, with
  trailing slashes removed, and it is provided as a convenience.
