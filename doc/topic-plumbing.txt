Plumbing Commands
=================

RockZ includes a few commands which are “hidden”: they do not show in the
output of “rockz help” and are not offered as candidates for completion.
These commands are intended to be used as an aid to write scripts which make
use of RockZ. All the commands are prefixed with an underscore.

_exists <name>
--------------

Checks whether a rockenv “<name>” exists. The exit status is non-zero if the
rockenv is missing.
